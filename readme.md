# Platform Warrior

## Description:
This game is my first try to develop a game. (maybe also for mobile platforms)
It will be developed in Unity with scripts written in the language C#.

## Game description:
I want the game to be a platformer. The player controlls a figure which is jumping on the platforms and has to fight against different kinds of enemys.
They will over time become harder to slay... 
There will be a level system / weapon level system which the player can use to get stronger weapons and defeat the stronger monsters.
